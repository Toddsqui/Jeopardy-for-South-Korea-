# Welcome to My Jeopardy Warehouse!
I intend to use this repository for all of the Jeopardy games that I am going to code for my wonderful little students in South Korea. Some of my high school students will invariably find this repository and when they do and confront me about it, I will say "huzzah," and run away. *giggle giggle*

### Instructions
To fork this repository, do the following:

1. Click the fork button
2. Use your Mac to click on the file that you forked and see it in the browser window
3. Use your text editor to edit the code. You can click and drag or right click the file and choose the text editor you want to use to open it up.

*Best of luck!*
